Hello, are you by chance poor and in need of money?
I am the owner of this hotel but its haunted. I need help.
I'll pay you if you clear out the ghosts. You'll need keys to do so.
Find 2 gold keys that are somewhere in the hotel to get to the 
basement. The basement door is up and the key in the lobby leads
to the rest of the hotel doors to the left and right. Good luck.
